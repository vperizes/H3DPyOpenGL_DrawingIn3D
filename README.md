# H3DPyOpenGL_DrawingIn3D
This repo includes the fifth and sixth project/tutorial from the course "Learn OpenGL with Python for Graphics and Games". The scripts in this project focus on building an understanding of camera transformations that allow 3D objects to be projected onto the screen. Specifically, this project explores live camera movements and visualizing world orientaiton. Additionally, the scripts here explore mesh transformation - including functionality for translating and rotating meshes while also manipulating camera movements. 

Using: Python 3.11.3
Packages: PyOpenGL, pygame
